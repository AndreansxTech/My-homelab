## I am going to write a curated tutorial, on how to step by step make L3 functions work on a Brocade FLS648 switch, based on what I found on different places on the internet and what I learned myself


### ❗️ For archival purposes in this folder I am sharing the firmware files for the Brocade FastIron LS648/STK. I do not own these files, but if someday the current mirror of these files go down, I think it is better to have a backup of them since I have that switch❗️

There seems to be no link to the ZIP folder on the Fohdeesha docs website, it is only in a post on Reddit posted around 10 years ago.
