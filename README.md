    - [ ] Purchase and configuration of 10GbE hardware
    - [ ] Migration of key services to the 10GbE network

[ .. more to come here .. ]

## Plans for now

For now I would like to create a NAS server, Backup server for proxmox, TFTP server for my network hardware, Plex / Jellyfin Media Server and Minecraft server. Currently Im learning general theory about VLANs.  *Expect to see some hand-drawn diagrams and notes as I work through these concepts!*

## Practical Networking: My Homelab Documentation üßê

This repository is a hands-on resource documenting my experiences with building and maintaining a homelab network. I‚Äôll be sharing practical configurations, scripts, and insights gained from real-world troubleshooting, with a focus on preserving knowledge about older or less common hardware. *In addition to text and code, I'm using my iPad and Apple Pencil to create visual notes, diagrams, and sketches that complement the technical details.*

A addition goal is to contribute to the longevity of network knowledge. This includes documenting solutions for obscure devices where information is scarce, and even archiving firmware and relevant resources to prevent them from disappearing from the internet. For example look at the <a href="https://github.com/AndreansxTech/My-homelab/blob/main/projects@home/issues@homelab/Brocade-FLS648-firmware-issue/overwiew.md">Brocade FLS648 issue</a>

Expect to find configuration files for network devices, server setups, files, and automation scripts ( with sensitive information redacted, naturally ). Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned network engineer or just starting out, I hope this repository provides valuable inspiration and guidance, and contributes to the collective knowledge of the networking community.

## Project Ignition: Laying the Foundation

While my fascination with technology dates back many years, my engagement was largely theoretical, limited to activities like custom ROM flashing. The turning point came during a summer break, when I realized the potential for building a dedicated learning environment within my home. A combination of a spacious room and readily available high-speed internet created the ideal conditions for a homelab.

The project officially launched in mid-October 2024 with the acquisition of two Dell PowerEdge servers: an R610 and an R710. Intrigued by the capabilities of Proxmox Virtual Environment, I quickly installed it on the R710 and began experimenting with virtual machines, deploying instances such as Windows 11 and a dedicated Ubuntu Server for hosting a Minecraft server. These initial steps laid the foundation for a more comprehensive exploration of network engineering principles.  *I'll be documenting this journey with a combination of text, code, and hand-written notes created on my iPad.*

## The Goal üìà

My objective is to develop practical skills in network engineering to pursue a career in this field. This homelab provides a platform to gain hands-on experience in areas such as:

*   Network design and implementation
*   Routing and switching protocols
*   Network security
*   Server administration
*   Troubleshooting and problem-solving

By actively engaging in these activities, I aim to acquire the knowledge and experience needed to excel in a network engineering role.
