## Milestones

‚úÖ - First servers </br>
‚ùå - Full setup with 1GbE </br>
[ .. more to come here .. ] </br>
‚ùå - NAS </br>
‚ùå - Full 10GbE </br>

## Plans for now

For now I would like to create a NAS server, Backup server for proxmox, TFTP server for my network hardware, Plex / Jellyfin Media Server and Minecraft server.
Currently Im learning general theory about VLANs


## What is this about? üßê
   This is a repository dedicated to documenting my journey with homelabing and general networking. I will upload the configuration files of my network hardware as well as servers configs and scripts if any will be made and everything in general ( as long as it is not something like a password of course )

## Start of the project
   I was interested in tech for kind of a long time. But never really did anything serious at my home apart from custom ROMing a couple of old samsung smartphones, until.. </br>
   Around the summer vacations I saw how big oppurtunities I had for creating a lab in my home. I have a big room and I have access to fast internet. Around the middle of October of 2024 I did my first step to creating a homelab. I bought two Dell PowerEdge servers: a R610 and a R710. </br>
   I learned some simple things about Proxmox Virtual Enviroment and realized how much potential it had. So I installed it on my R710. I created some simple VMs such as a Win11 or Ubuntu Server for a Minecraft Server.

## The goal üìà
   I would love to work in network engineering in the future. I know that apart from the very important theoretical knowledge, the practical experience is the most important. That's why I picked up this project. Hopefully I will gain the useful knowledge and experience needed to land a job in my target field. A job in networking sure requires maintaining physical hardware. A homelab is a widely known way of learing to fix errors and learn from our own mistakes.
