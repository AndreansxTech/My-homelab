Im currently learning about L3 and I took a easy practise Network+ test to swe how much I learned. I will also try to start learning Python more seriously as I found that it is great for automation in networking

   As for now, I was mostly messing around with the FastIron LS648 and tried to get the L3 to work.</br>
   
   I guess I can say it was a success but not 100% ( for now ). However, it surely wasn't easy. It took a lot of lurking and searching around to get some info.</br>
   
   This switch is so old as hell that there is barely someone who heard about it, and even less people who messed around with it's L3 functionality.
