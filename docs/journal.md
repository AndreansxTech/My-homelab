## I will try to write at least one entry a day here. They will mostly consist of general mention what I am doing at the time and a link to a file that Im modyfying

## *16.03.2025*

Today I didn`t really have time to study much about routing because of school, but I will try tomorrow


## *15.03.2025*
Today I worked on a project for the Terminalcraft event from Hackclub.</br>

## *14.03.2025*

I was still learning some more things about L3 switches. </br>
I also got an idea for *( maybe )* better descriptions for the network hardware.
</br>

</br></br>
I started taking my iPad to school and to be honest, even though it is just a base model *( the cheapest of iPads )*, I really enjoy taking notes on it. So, it really does not mean much that it is the base version with only 64GB of memory. Pretty cool device overall


## *13.03.2025*

I was thinking about implementing a inventory system in the homelab using Netbox. </br>
Just gotta learn more about it


## *12.03.2024*

For now, Im still just learning about routing etc. </br>
Nothing more really


## *11.03.2025*

Finally my package with a Xeon X5670 arrived. Now I have two identical CPUs for my R710. Those will increase the threads number to 24 and also they have a higher clock speed


## *10.03.2025*

I wrote a better VLANs description. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/AndreansxTech/My-homelab/blob/eaf16325591678c4caee6029cdcf21f62f59324a/docs/VLANs.md">here</a>


## *09.03.2025* 

Im currently learning about L3 and I took a easy practise Network+ test to swe how much I learned. I will also try to start learning Python more seriously as I found that it is great for automation in networking. </br>

The libraries and tools that I should be familiar with are:

- Netmiko
- NAPALM
- Ansible

So I will start learning something about then.</br> Of course every piece of code, I will write, I will also upload to this repo.

   As for now, I was mostly messing around with the FastIron LS648 and tried to get the L3 to work.</br>
   
   I guess I can say it was a success but not 100% ( for now ). However, it surely wasn't easy. It took a lot of lurking and searching around to get some info.</br>
   
   This switch is so old as hell that there is barely someone who heard about it, and even less people who messed around with it's L3 functionality.
