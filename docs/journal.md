   As for now, I was mostly messing around with the FastIron LS648 and tried to get the L3 to work.</br>
   
   I guess I can say it was a success but not 100% ( for now ). However, it surely wasn't easy. It took a lot of lurking and searching around to get some info.</br>
   
   This switch is so old as hell that there is barely someone who heard about it, even less, messed around with it's L3 functionality.
